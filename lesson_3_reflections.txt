When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

to share results with others;
for collaborative work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In a collaborative work, I don't want to mix it to my own work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks work in GitHub to make a copy to another user. Clones work at GitHub and locally to make a copy for the same user. Branches work at local repository only.
When I am interested in another user's project, I clone it to my repository. When I want repository locally, I clone it. When I want to add another feature or developer to the project, I branch it.
