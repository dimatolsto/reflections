What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git created a snapshot of all files in a repository. We need it to track all the changes in the files after commit it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate place for files to be commited.
