What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git created a snapshot of all files in a repository. We need it to track all the changes in the files after commit it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate place for files to be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use git diff --staged command
